# PHP Technology Profile

This profile is authoritative for this implementation.

- Language and runtime: PHP 8.3.
- Web framework: Slim 4 with PSR-7 request and response handling.
- Database: SQLite through PDO using a repository/data-access layer.
- Authentication: server-side sessions identified by an HTTP-only cookie; persistent session records are stored in SQLite.
- Browser client: server-served HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Real-time transport: when a use case requires WebSocket behavior, provide a Workerman-based local WebSocket process sharing the same SQLite data; otherwise use ordinary HTTP.
- Dependency tooling: Composer with exact direct dependency constraints and a committed `composer.lock`.
- Configuration: environment variables documented in `.env.example`.
- Local execution: provide database reset/seed and start commands that work without paid services or external accounts.
- Containerization: provide a Dockerfile and compose file for reproducible local execution.
