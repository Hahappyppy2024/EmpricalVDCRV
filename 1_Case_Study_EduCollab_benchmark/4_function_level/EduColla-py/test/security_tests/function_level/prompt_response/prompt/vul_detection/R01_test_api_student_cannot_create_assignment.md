You are a web application security auditor (vulnerability detector).

### 1) Task
Diagnose why the SECURITY TEST below fails. Use ONLY the test and the provided code snippets. Do NOT write any code diff in this step. Output a minimal, concrete repair plan for the next step.




### 2) Function Feature (security property)

Role- and membership-based API access control: students cannot create 
assignments and non-members cannot access a course’s post list 
(must return 401/403 when the endpoints exist).


### 3) Failed Security Test

import pytest

from .._helpers import api_get, api_post_json, ensure_user_and_membership

        pytest.skip("API endpoint not implemented for assignment creation")

    # TRUE-PASS oracle: if endpoint exists, student must be rejected
    # (Use 401/403 only; anything else means policy/implementation is unclear or wrong)
    assert rv.status_code in (401, 403), f"Expected 401/403 for student, got {rv.status_code}"

    # Guardrail: if it somehow succeeds, fail loudly (redundant but explicit)
    assert rv.status_code not in (200, 201)

    rv = client.get(f"/api/courses/{course_id}/posts", follow_redirects=False)

    if rv.status_code == 404:

### 4) Relevant Application Code (ONLY what is pasted exists)
{CODE_SNIPPETS: routes + middleware + controller (+ repo/view if needed)}

### 5) Output Requirements (STRICT)
Your response MUST contain exactly the following 7 sections, in this exact order, with the exact headings.
- Do NOT add extra sections.
- Do NOT omit any section.
- Do NOT output any code diff.

[1] VulnType
Choose exactly ONE label from: R01 R02 R03 R04 R05 R06 R07 R08 R09 R10
Format:
VulnType: Rxx

[2] TestMapping
2–4 bullets mapping: (expected by test) -> (observed) -> (code cause).
Each bullet MUST reference a concrete code point shown (route/middleware/function name).
Format:
TestMapping:
- ...
- ...

[3] RootCause
2–4 bullets pointing to the exact missing/incorrect check and where it should be enforced (route/middleware/controller).
Format:
RootCause:
- ...
- ...

[4] RepairPlan
3–7 bullets. EACH bullet MUST include BOTH:
- Target: <file/snippet name + function/route>
- Change: <exact edit>
Format:
RepairPlan:
- Target: ... | Change: ...
- Target: ... | Change: ...
- Target: ... | Change: ...

[5] ReliabilityClaim
Exactly ONE sentence explaining why this diagnosis is supported by the given test + code (no speculation).
Format:
ReliabilityClaim: ...

[6] RegressionRisks
1–3 bullets listing what might break and what should be rechecked later.
Format:
RegressionRisks:
- ...
- ...

[7] SelfCheck (YES/NO + Score: + evidence)
Format:
SelfCheck:
- PlanComplete: YES/NO | Score: 0/1 | Evidence: "..."
- GroundedTestMapping: YES/NO | Score: 0/1 | Evidence: "..."

Constraints:
- Do NOT invent filenames, tests, or endpoints beyond what is shown.
- Keep the plan minimal and localized.
